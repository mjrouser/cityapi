<p>Cities all over the world have spaces that are just not being used.  The Lower East Side of Manhattan alone has over 200 empty lots and storefronts.  The causes for this blight are many, and can lead to lots of unwanted side effects.  While this problem is not new, the proliferation of the social web and mobile technologies have given us new tools to work with to help fill in these gaps and shape the city the way that we as residents would like to see it.</p>
<p>We here at CityAPI are working to develop a new approach to creating places of interest in our communities.  We believe that it should be an open process and that it should bring people together rather than divide them.  We have brought our experience from many walks of life, including city planning, art, design and education together to help ask you the question "what do you want to do with this space?" </p>
<p>With this platform, you, the resident, can create/meet/build in ways that serve your community's unique needs.  It's free to access, and free to use, so find that spot on your block that's been bothering you and get started!</p>
<p>Check out our Help section for a quick tour, or if you have any questions, and please contact us at any time if you have comments.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>The CityAPI team</p>
